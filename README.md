## Announcements

* **August 28, 2017** Release
[0.5.4](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/tag/0.5.4) is
now available!  This will be the last stable tag before requiring Bazel 0.5.4 and toolchains support.
* **August 9, 2017** Release
[0.5.3](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/releases/tag/0.5.3) is
now available!
* **July 27, 2017** Bazel 0.5.3 is now available. This includes a change which
is incompatible with rules\_go 0.5.1 and earlier. rules\_go 0.5.2 should work.

## Overview

The rules are in the alpha stage of development. They support:

* libraries
* binaries
* tests
* vendoring
* cgo
* cross compilation
* auto generating BUILD files via [gazelle](go/tools/gazelle/README.md)
* protocol buffers (via extension //proto:go_proto_library.bzl)

They currently do not support (in order of importance):

* bazel-style auto generating BUILD (where the library name is other than
  go_default_library)
* C/C++ interoperation except cgo (swig etc.)
* coverage
* test sharding

**Note:** The latest version of these rules (0.5.4) require Bazel ≥ 0.5.2 to
  work.

The `master` branch is only guaranteed to work with the latest version of Bazel.

## Setup

* Create a file at the top of your repository named `WORKSPACE`, and add one
  of the following snippets, verbatim. This will let Bazel fetch necessary
  dependencies from this repository and a few others.
  If you're using the latest stable release you can use the following contents:

    ```bzl
    git_repository(
        name = "io_bazel_rules_go",
        remote = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go.git",
        tag = "0.5.4",
    )
    load("@io_bazel_rules_go//go:def.bzl", "go_repositories")

    go_repositories()
    ```

  If you're using rules_go at or near the HEAD of master, you can use the
  following contents (optionally replacing the commit with something newer):

    ```bzl
    git_repository(
        name = "io_bazel_rules_go",
        remote = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go.git",
        commit = "d8d73c918ed7b59a5584e0cab4f5274d2f91faab",
    )
    load("@io_bazel_rules_go//go:def.bzl", "go_rules_dependencies", "go_register_toolchains")

    go_rules_dependencies()
    go_register_toolchains()
    ```

  You can add more external dependencies to this file later (see
  [go_repository](#go_repository) below).

* Add a file named `BUILD.bazel` or `BUILD` in the root directory of your
  project. In general, you need one of these files in every directory
  with Go code, but you need one in the root directory even if your project
  doesn't have any Go code there.

* Decide on a *prefix* for your project, e.g., `github.com/example/project`.
  This must be a prefix of the import paths for libraries in your project. It
  should generally be the repository URL. Bazel will use this prefix to convert
  between import paths and labels in build files.

* If your project can be built with `go build`, you can
  [generate your build files](#generating-build-files) using Gazelle. If your
  project isn't compatible with `go build` or if you prefer not to use Gazelle,
  you can [write build files by hand](#writing-build-files-by-hand).

### Generating build files

If your project can be built with `go build`, you can generate and update your
build files automatically using Gazelle, a tool included in this repository.
See the [Gazelle README](go/tools/gazelle/README.md) for more information.

* Add the code below to the `BUILD.bazel` file in your repository's
  root directory. Replace the `prefix` string with the prefix you chose for
  your project earlier.

```bzl
load("@io_bazel_rules_go//go:def.bzl", "gazelle")

gazelle(
    name = "gazelle",
    prefix = "github.com/example/project",
)
```

* If your project uses vendoring, add `external = "vendored",` below the
  `prefix` line.

* After adding the `gazelle` rule, run the command below:

```bzl
bazel run //:gazelle
```

  This will generate a `BUILD.bazel` file for each Go package in your
  repository.  You can run the same command in the future to update existing
  build files with new source files, dependencies, and options.

### Writing build files by hand

If your project doesn't follow `go build` conventions or you prefer not to use
Gazelle, you can write build files by hand.

* In each directory that contains Go code, create a file named `BUILD.bazel`
  or `BUILD` (Bazel recognizes both names).

* Add a `load` statement at the top of the file for the rules you use.

```bzl
load("@io_bazel_rules_go//go:def.bzl", "go_binary", "go_library", "go_test")
```

* For each library, add a [`go_library`](#go_library) rule like the one below.
  Source files are listed in `srcs`. Other packages you import are listed in
  `deps` using
  [Bazel labels](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/build-ref.html#labels)
  that refer to other `go_library` rules. The library's import path should
  be specified with `importpath`.

```bzl
go_library(
    name = "go_default_library",
    srcs = [
        "foo.go",
        "bar.go",
    ],
    deps = [
        "//tools:go_default_library",
        "@org_golang_x_utils//stuff:go_default_library",
    ],
    importpath = "github.com/example/project/foo",
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)
```

* For each test, add a [`go_test`](#go_test) rule like either of the ones below.
  You'll need separate `go_test` rules for internal and external tests.

```bzl
# Internal test
go_test(
    name = "go_default_test",
    srcs = ["foo_test.go"],
    importpath = "github.com/example/project/foo",
    library = ":go_default_library",
)

# External test
go_test(
    name = "go_default_xtest",
    srcs = ["bar_test.go"],
    deps = [":go_default_library"],
    importpath = "github.com/example/project/foo",
)
```

* For each binary, add a [`go_binary`](#go_binary) rule like the one below.

```bzl
go_binary(
    name = "foo",
    srcs = ["main.go"],
    deps = [":go_default_library"],
    importpath = "github.com/example/project/foo",
)
```

* For instructions on how to depend on external libraries,
  see [Vendoring.md](Vendoring.md).

## Build modes

### Building static binaries

You can build binaries in static linking mode using
```
bazel build --output_groups=static //:my_binary
```

You can depend on static binaries (e.g., for packaging) using `filegroup`:

```bzl
go_binary(
    name = "foo",
    srcs = ["foo.go"],
)

filegroup(
    name = "foo_static",
    srcs = [":foo"],
    output_group = "static",
)
```

### Using the race detector

You can run tests with the race detector enabled using
```
bazel test --features=race //...
```

You can build binaries with the race detector enabled using
```
bazel build --output_groups=race //...
```

The difference is necessary because the rules for binaries can produce both
race and non-race versions, but tools used during the build should always be
built in the non-race configuration. `--output_groups` is needed to select
the configuration of the final binary only. For tests, only one executable
can be tested, and `--features` is needed to select the race configuration.

## FAQ

### Can I still use the `go` tool?

Yes, this setup was deliberately chosen to be compatible with `go build`.
Make sure your project appears in `GOPATH`, and it should work.

Note that `go build` won't be aware of dependencies listed in `WORKSPACE`, so
these will be downloaded into `GOPATH`. You may also need to check in generated
files.

### What's up with the `go_default_library` name?

This was used to keep import paths consistent in libraries that can be built
with `go build` before the `importpath` attribute was available.

In order to compile and link correctly, the Go rules need to be able to
translate Bazel labels to Go import paths. Libraries that don't set the
`importpath` attribute explicitly have an implicit dependency on `//:go_prefix`,
a special rule that specifies an import path prefix. The import path is
the prefix concatenated with the Bazel package and target name. For example,
if your prefix was `github.com/example/project`, and your library was
`//foo/bar:bar`, the Go rules would decide the import path was
`github.com/example/project/foo/bar/bar`. The stutter at the end is incompatible
with `go build`, so if the label name is `go_default_library`, the import path
is just the prefix concatenated with the package name. So if your library is
`//foo/bar:go_default_library`, the import path is
`github.com/example/project/foo/bar`.

We are working on deprecating `go_prefix` and making `importpath` mandatory (see
[#721](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/issues/721)). When this work is
complete, the `go_default_library` name won't be needed. We may decide to stop
using this name in the future (see
[#265](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/issues/265)).

## Repository rules

### `go_rules_dependencies`

``` bzl
go_rules_dependencies()
```

Adds Go-related external dependencies to the WORKSPACE, including the Go
toolchain and standard library. All the other workspace rules and build rules
assume that this rule is placed in the WORKSPACE.
When [nested workspaces](https://bazel.build/designs/2016/09/19/recursive-ws-parsing.html) arrive this will be redundant.

### `go_register_toolchains`

``` bzl
go_register_toolchains(go_version)
```

Installs the Go toolchains. If `go_version` is specified, it sets the SDK version to use (for example, `"1.8.2"`). By default, the latest SDK will be used.


### `go_repository`

```bzl
go_repository(name, importpath, commit, tag, vcs, remote, urls, strip_prefix, type, sha256, build_file_name, build_file_generation, build_tags)
```

Fetches a remote repository of a Go project, and generates `BUILD.bazel` files
if they are not already present. In vcs mode, it recognizes importpath
redirection.

`importpath` must always be specified. This is used as the root import path
for libraries in the repository.

If the repository should be fetched using a VCS, either `commit` or `tag`
must be specified. `remote` and `vcs` may be specified if they can't be
inferred from `importpath` using the
[normal go logic](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Remote_import_paths).

If the repository should be fetched using source archives, `urls` and `sha256`
must be specified. `strip_prefix` and `type` may be specified to control how
the archives are unpacked.

`build_file_name`, `build_file_generation`, and `build_tags` may be used to
control how BUILD.bazel files are generated. By default, Gazelle will generate
BUILD.bazel files if they are not already present.

#### Example:

The rule below fetches a repository with Git. Import path redirection is used
to automatically determine the true location of the repository.

```bzl
load("@io_bazel_rules_go//go:def.bzl", "go_repository")

go_repository(
    name = "org_golang_x_tools",
    importpath = "golang.org/x/tools",
    commit = "663269851cdddc898f963782f74ea574bcd5c814",
)
```

The rule below fetches a repository archive with HTTP. GitHub provides HTTP
archives for all repositories. It's generally faster to fetch these than to
checkout a repository with Git, but the `strip_prefix` part can break if the
repository is renamed.

```bzl
load("@io_bazel_rules_go//go:def.bzl", "go_repository")

go_repository(
    name = "org_golang_x_tools",
    importpath = "golang.org/x/tools",
    urls = ["https://codeload.github.com/golang/tools/zip/663269851cdddc898f963782f74ea574bcd5c814"],
    strip_prefix = "tools-663269851cdddc898f963782f74ea574bcd5c814",
    type = "zip",
)
```

### `new_go_repository`

**DEPRECATED** Use [`go_repository`](#go_repository) instead, which has the same
functionality.

## Build rules

### `go_prefix`

```bzl
go_prefix(prefix)
```

**DEPRECATED** Set the `importpath` attribute on all rules instead of using
`go_prefix`. See #721.

`go_prefix` declares the common prefix of the import path which is shared by
all Go libraries in the repository. A `go_prefix` rule must be declared in the
top-level BUILD file for any repository containing Go rules. This is used by the
Bazel rules during compilation to map import paths to dependencies. See the
[FAQ](#whats-up-with-the-go_default_library-name) for more information.

### `go_library`

```bzl
go_library(name, srcs, deps, data, importpath, gc_goopts, cgo, cdeps, copts, clinkopts)
```

`go_library` builds a Go library from a set of source files that are all part of
the same package.

```

### `cgo_library`

```bzl
cgo_library(name, srcs, copts, clinkopts, cdeps, deps, data, gc_goopts)
```

**DEPRECATED** Use `go_library` with `cgo = True` instead.

`cgo_library` builds a Go library from a set of cgo source files that are part
of the same package. This library cannot contain pure Go code (see the note
below).

#### NOTE

`srcs` cannot contain pure-Go files, which do not have `import "C"`.
So you need to define another `go_library` when you build a go package with
both cgo-enabled and pure-Go sources.

```bzl
cgo_library(
    name = "cgo_enabled",
    srcs = ["cgo-enabled.go", "foo.cc", "bar.S", "baz.a"],
)

go_library(
    name = "go_default_library",
    srcs = ["pure-go.go"],
    library = ":cgo_enabled",
)
```

### `go_binary`

```bzl
go_binary(name, srcs, deps, data, importpath, library, cgo, cdeps, copts, clinkopts, linkstamp, x_defs, gc_goopts, gc_linkopts)
```

`go_binary` builds an executable from a set of source files, which must all be
in the `main` package. You can run the binary with `bazel run`, or you can
build it with `bazel build` and run it directly.

### `go_test`

```bzl
go_test(name, srcs, deps, data, importpath, library,
    cgo, cdeps, copts, clinkopts,
    linkstamp, x_defs, gc_goopts, gc_linkopts, rundir)
```

`go_test` builds a set of tests that can be run with `bazel test`. This can
contain sources for internal tests or external tests, but not both (see example
below).

To run all tests in the workspace, and print output on failure (the
equivalent of "go test ./..." from `go_prefix` in a `GOPATH` tree), run

```
bazel test --test_output=errors //...
```

You can run specific tests by passing the
[`--test_filter=pattern`](https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/bazel-user-manual.html#flag--test_filter)
argument to Bazel. You can pass arguments to tests by passing
[`--test_arg=arg`](https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/bazel-user-manual.html#flag--test_arg)
arguments to Bazel.

#### Example

To write an internal test, reference the library being tested with the `library`
attribute instead of the `deps` attribute. This will compile the test sources
into the same package as the library sources.

``` bzl
go_library(
    name = "go_default_library",
    srcs = ["lib.go"],
)

go_test(
    name = "go_default_test",
    srcs = ["lib_test.go"],
    library = ":go_default_library",
)
```

To write an external test, reference the library being tested with the `deps`
attribute.

``` bzl
go_library(
    name = "go_default_library",
    srcs = ["lib.go"],
)

go_test(
    name = "go_default_xtest",
    srcs = ["lib_x_test.go"],
    deps = [":go_default_library"],
)
```

#### Example:

The `foo_data` rule below will generate a file named `foo_data.go`, which can
be included in a library. Gazelle will find and add these files
automatically.

```bzl
load("@io_bazel_rules_go//go:def.bzl", "go_embed_data", "go_library")

go_embed_data(
    name = "foo_data",
    src = "foo.txt",
    out = "foo_data.go",
    package = "foo",
    string = True,
    var = "Data",
)

go_library(
    name = "go_default_library",
    srcs = ["foo_data.go"],
)
```

The generated file will look like this:

```go
// Generated by go_embed_data for //:foo_data. DO NOT EDIT.

package foo



var Data = "Contents of foo.txt"
```
